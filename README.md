# Diabetes classification

## Overview
This project contains two main sections: **Supervised** and **Unsupervised**. The data required for both sections is located in the `data` folder, provided in CSV format. Make sure you have Python installed before setting up the environment.

## Setup Instructions

To get started, you'll need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine if you haven't done so already.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denisangel2k2/machine-learning-sp
cd machine-learning-sp
```
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Setting up a virtual environment helps isolate dependencies and avoids conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

#### For windows:
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### For Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Data Structure

Data for this project is organized in the `data` folder in CSV format. Make sure to use the correct paths in your scripts to access the data files.

### 5. Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

-   **Supervised**: Contains code and resources related to supervised learning tasks.
-   **Unsupervised**: Contains code and resources related to unsupervised learning tasks.

### 6. Running the Code

Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, navigate to either the `Supervised` or `Unsupervised` directories as needed to run scripts.
